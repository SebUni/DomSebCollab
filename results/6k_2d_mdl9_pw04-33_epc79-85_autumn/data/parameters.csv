time_step,5,Length of each time step in minutes
time_step_limit,4032,Amount of time steps executed before simulation termination (288 is 1 day in 5 min steps).
forecast_horizon,1440,Time for solar forecast
company_charger_cost_per_kWh,0.08,Price charged by companies per kWh charged
public_charger_cost_per_kWh,0.52,Price charged while using public chargers per kWh charged
employees_per_charger,1,Amount of employees sharing one charger at a company
arrival_time_reserve,10,Time a car_agent tires to be early to accomodate for traffic and other delays
departure_condition,ONE_WAY_TRIP,Ensures that car never runs out of power midway. Can take three different values: ROUND_TRIP / ONE_WAY_TRIP
