Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI): The total irradiance received on a horizontal surface. It is the sum of the horizontal components of direct (beam) and diffuse irradiance. Units in W/m2.

Direct (Beam) Horizontal Irradiance (EBH): The horizontal component of Direct Normal Irradiance. Units in W/m2.

Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI): Solar irradiance arriving in a direct line from the sun as measured on a surface held perpendicular to the sun. Units in W/m2.

Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI): The horizontal component of diffuse irradiance (irradiance that is scattered by the atmosphere). Units in W/m2.

Zenith: The angle between a line perpendicular to the earth's surface and the sun (90 deg = sunrise and sunset; 0 deg = sun directly overhead). Units in degrees.

Azimuth: The angle between a line pointing due north to the sun's current position in the sky. Negative to the East. Positive to the West. 0 at due North. Units in degrees.

Cloud Opacity: The measurement of how opaque the clouds are to solar radiation in the given location (0 = no cloud, 100 = full attenuation of incoming light). Units in percentage.

Air temp: The air temperature (2 meters above ground level). Units in Celsius.

Relative humidity: The air relative humidity (2 meters above ground level). Units in percentage.

Wind speed: The wind speed (10 meters above ground level). Units in m/s.

Wind direction: The wind direction (10 meters above ground level). This is the meteorological convention. 0 is a northerly (from the north); 90 is an easterly (from the east); 180 is a southerly (from the south); 270 is a westerly (from the west). Units in degrees.

Precip water: The total column preciptable water content. Units in kg/m2.
Snow depth: The snow depth liquid-water-equivalent. Units in cm.

Albedo: Average daytime surface reflectivity of visible light, expressed as a value between 0 and 1. 0 represents complete absorption. 1 represents complete reflection.
